### DPPInstaller
A simple, unofficial installer for https://dpp.dev/, tested only on raspberry pi OS.

If you get a CMake error like "I can't find openssl", but openssl is already installed on the device, try to install `libssl-dev` as I founded on this stackoverflow thread, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248775/cmake-not-able-to-find-openssl-library
